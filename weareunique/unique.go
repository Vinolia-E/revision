/* Instructions

Write a function that takes two strings's and returns the number of characters that are not included in both, without repeating characters.

    If there is no unique characters return 0.
    If both strings are empty return -1.

Expected function

Here is a possible program to test your function:

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(WeAreUnique("foo", "boo"))
	fmt.Println(WeAreUnique("", ""))
	fmt.Println(WeAreUnique("abc", "def"))
